# API Requirements

The company stakeholders want to create an online storefront to showcase their great product ideas. Users need to be able to browse an index of all products, see the specifics of a single product, and add products to an order that they can view in a cart page. You have been tasked with building the API that will support this application, and your coworker is building the frontend.

These are the notes from a meeting with the frontend developer that describe what endpoints the API needs to supply, as well as data shapes the frontend and backend have agreed meet the requirements of the application.

## API Endpoints

#### Products

- [GET] '/products'
- [GET] '/products/:id'
- [POST] '/products' [Token required]
- [DELETE] '/products/:id' [Token required]

#### Users

- [GET] '/users' [Token required]
- [GET] '/users/:id' [Token required]
- [POST] '/users' [Token required]
- [POST] '/users/authenticate' [Login]
- [PUT] '/users/:id' [Token required] [Token required]

#### Orders

- [GET] '/orders/:id' [Token required]

## Data Shapes

### Schema ecommerce-db

#### Product

- id: Number
- name: string
- price: Number
- [OPTIONAL] description: string

```
CREATE TABLE product (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
```

#### User

- id: Number
- name: string
- email: string
- password: string as password_digest

```
CREATE TABLE user_account (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    password_digest VARCHAR(255)
);
```

#### Orders - I have created a new table "order_item" to attend the requirements.

- id?: Number
- status: string
- user_id: Number
- items: Item[]

##### Requirements

- id
- id of each product in the order
- quantity of each product in the order
- user_id
- status: string (Active or Complete)

```
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    quantity integer,
    status VARCHAR(100),
    product_id integer NOT NULL,
    user_id integer NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES user_account (id)
);
```

#### Item

- id?: Number
- quantity: Number
- order_id: Number
- product_id: Number

```
CREATE TABLE order_item (
    id integer NOT NULL GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    quantity integer,
    order_id integer NOT NULL,
    product_id integer NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES "order" (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES product (id)
);
```
